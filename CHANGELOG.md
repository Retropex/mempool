# v0.0.4 â€“ Parsing everything

This version finally brings support for all types of inscriptions and features to Ordpool:

* Inscriptions on inputs after the first
* Batch inscriptions via pointers (see [pointer docs](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions/pointer.html))
* Parent inscriptions (see [provenance docs](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions/provenance.html))
* Metadata and Metaprotocol (see [metadata docs](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions/metadata.html)), which is important for [CBRC-20](https://cybord.org/)
* Brotli content-encoding
* Support for multiple parents
* Support for minimal push numbers (OP_PUSHNUM) for tags, which are not encoded by `ord` but by [Chisel](https://chisel.xyz)

We also added experimental support for Bitcoin Stamps (SRC-20).
'Experimental' means that SRC-20 Bitcoin Transactions are highlighted in the Mempool Block Overview and shown on the Transaction-Details page, but they are not highlighted for confirmed blocks.

**More Features:**

* CSS, JavaScript, and JSON are now formatted and displayed with Syntax-Highlighting

**Bugfixes:**

- Parser is not aware of batch inscriptions, see [#2](https://github.com/haushoppe/ordpool/issues/2)
- Download links to Xverse and Unisat were mixed


# v0.0.3 â€“ ordpool-parser

**New Feature:**

We've extracted the Inscription parser to a separate repository! 
Now it's your turn! Fork it and add support for Bitcoin Stamps, Atomicals or any other Metaprotocol.
Can't wait to see what you come up with! ðŸš€
